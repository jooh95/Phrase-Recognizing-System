Abstract

A wireless ad-hoc network includes huge number of mobile nodes that structure temporary networks. Due to the
dynamic nature of wireless ad-hoc network, security and
eﬃcient intrusion detection system (IDS) is a challenging task to detect the intruder nodes. The classiﬁcation
algorithm is used to detect the intrusions in an eﬃcient
manner. However, the network is characterized by high
mobility they also introduce many vulnerabilities that increase their accurate detection risks. The optimization
technique is performed to attain eﬀective model for intrusion detection. But, the IDS continuously use additional
resources to monitoring intruder activity in the network.
In order to overcome the above issues in wireless ad-hoc
network, Simulated Annealing based Naive Bayes Classiﬁer (SA-NBC) technique is proposed for Anomaly Intrusion Detection. An anomaly-based intrusion detection
system is used to detect the network intrusions and monitoring network activities in an exact manner. At ﬁrst,
the optimal features are chosen for classifying and detecting the intrusion by means of Simulated Annealing (SA)
method when performing packet transmission. Based on
these selected features, the accuracy and eﬃciency of trafﬁc pattern analysis is improved using intrusion detection.
Next, the Naive Bayes classiﬁer is employed to classify
the attack depends on features to identify the malicious
behavior accurately from normal node in a testing environment by using the Bayes theorem. This in turns,
the network traﬃc is minimized and increases the accuracy of anomaly intrusion detection. The SA-NBC technique conducts the simulations work on parameters such
as anomaly intrusion detection accuracy, execution time,
and throughput. The simulation results demonstrate that
the SA-NBC technique is able to improve the accuracy
of intrusion detection and also improves the throughput

when compared to state-of-the-art works.

Introduction

A wireless ad hoc network (WANET) is a decentralized
network without having any ﬁxed infrastructure. Wireless
ad-hoc networks are essentially used in the tactical battleﬁeld, emergency explore and civilian ad-hoc locations.
The nodes in wireless ad-hoc network communicate with
each other nodes through the intermediate node. Due to
the diverse characteristic of mobile ad hoc networks, the
various intrusions aﬀect the network performance thus increases the traﬃc. In addition, limited transmission range
of wireless network introduces the communication traﬃc
over a number of nodes.

A novel IDS called as Adaptive Three Acknowledgements (A3ACKs) was introduced in [17] for MANETs. In
A3ACKs, watchdog technique was applied to solve the
issues in data transmission. However, the packet delivery ratio was not improved.
In [15], a novel intrusiondetection system called as Enhanced Adaptive ACKnowledgment (EAACK) was developed to increase the
malicious-behavior-detection rates in MANETs. However, the network overhead was high and the normal or
anomalous behavior activities are diﬃcult to identify.

A new method called as hash message authentication
code (HMAC) was introduced in [4] to overcome the primary user attack in cognitive radio networks. However,
the interferences are occurred in the HMAC through the
transmission process. Security assurance process properties uniﬁcation was developed in [12] to solve the security
demands when handling logical vulnerability in system.

However, some network issues are not exposed or identiﬁed.

In [16], Intrusion detection systems were introduced to
solve the availability attacks in ad-hoc networks. However, the performance of the network was not improved.
A hybrid detection system called Hybrid Intrusion Detection System (H-IDS) [13] was developed to detect the
DDoS attacks. The H-IDS uses both anomaly-based and
signature-based detection methods. However, the detection accuracy of intrusion detection is not eﬃcient.

In [1], a new intrusion detection system was introduced
based on neuro-fuzzy classiﬁer for avoiding the packet
drops in mobile ad hoc networks. Anomalous node in
network is isolated from the normal activities by using
SVM classiﬁer. An IDS based on anomaly based intrusion detection was developed in [8] by protecting the network node behavior to overcome the attacks. However,
the packet delivery ratio was not suﬃcient.

Intrusion detection in MANETs using statistical classiﬁcation algorithms [10] was developed to improve the
classiﬁer performance. A normalized gain based IDS was
introduced in [19] for MAC Intrusions (NMI) detection to
choose an optimal feature subset in training the classiﬁer.
However, the time consumed for classiﬁcation was high.
The contribution of the paper is organized as follows:
Simulated Annealing based Naive Bayes classiﬁer (SANBC) technique is developed in wireless ad-hoc network
for Anomaly Intrusion detection. Initially, with the aid
of Simulated Annealing (SA) in SA-NBC technique, the
optimal features of the nodes are selected to classify the
intrusion in packet transmission. Next, by considering
optimal feature selection, the traﬃc pattern accuracy is
improved in the network. Finally, NB classiﬁer is used to
classify the node whether it is normal or anomalous by
using the conditional probability function and therefore
improves the intrusion detection accuracy and reduces the
execution time for intrusion detection.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Detailed
description of the method is provided in Section 2.
In
Section 3 the simulation environment is presented and
the results are explained in Section 4. Section 5 presents
a brief introduction of related works. Finally, the concluding remarks are presented in Section 6.

2 Methodology

Due to the higher mobility of nodes in wireless ad-hoc
network, the diﬀerent intrusions are occurred at the network transmission. A network intrusion is also called as
the unauthorized activity on a computer network. The
aim of intrusion detection is identify the various types of
misbehavior activity. This misbehavior activity utilizes
the network resources and accesses the data through the
transmission for reducing network performance. Generally eﬃcient modeling and organizing a network intrusion detection system is used to detect the intruders from
the network. Therefore, an eﬃcient IDS uses Simulated

Annealing based Naive Bayes Classiﬁer (SA-NBC) technique for anomaly intrusion detection in wireless ad-hoc
network.

2.1 System Model

In this section, a system model for designing with Naive
Bayes classiﬁer is presented. Let us consider a WANET
with number of node, Ni = N1, N2,··· , Nn, distributed
in a given rectangular area.

2.2 Problem Deﬁnition

The major challenging problem in wireless ad-hoc network includes the lack of reliable data transmission due
to its mobility and hence it is more prone to intrusion
threats. With increases of anomalous in ad-hoc network
leads to degrade the network performance. The anomaly
intrusion detection is a basic issue for intrusion detection
in ad-hoc network. The problem of classify the normal
and abnormal nodes during the data transmission is considered in this work with the aim of obtaining improved
intrusion detection accuracy using Simulated Annealing
based Naive Bayes classiﬁer technique.

Generally, intrusion detection techniques are diﬃcult
to distinguish the activities whether it is normal or
anomalous. However the network resources are utilized
by malicious activity and unable to compromise a classiﬁcation. Hence, eﬃcient intrusion detection system (IDSs)
is needs to increase the throughput of network by means
of classifying behavior of the nodes.

2.3 Simulated Annealing Based NB Classiﬁer

A Simulated Annealing based NB classiﬁer (SA-NBC)
technique is developed with the aim of increasing the
anomaly intrusion detection accuracy in wireless ad-hoc
networks. Due to the diﬀerent features of node the computational complexity is occurred in the network. In order to overcome the above issues, the SA-NBC technique
uses the simulated annealing (SA) method that extracts
the optimal feature. Each feature contains the diﬀerent
values in data packets that are produced by diﬀerent attacks. The group of feature values is separated into various classes. Hence, an optimal feature is selected eﬃciently and reduces the computation time of IDS thus
improves the detection accuracy using classiﬁer.

The NB classiﬁer is used to classify the malicious behavior accurately using SA-NBC technique.
It reduces
the failure of unidentiﬁed process and mainly employs the
classiﬁcation task that directs to lack of cascade classiﬁcation in the intrusion classiﬁcation process. Therefore, the
NB classiﬁer performs an intrusion classiﬁcation process
by means of separating the optimal features through monitoring the malicious activities in precise manner. The
architecture of SA-NBC technique for anomaly intrusion
detection and classiﬁcation is shown in Figure 1.

at each temperature level. Lastly, the particle arrives a
ground state at normal temperature and thus the internal
energy minimized to a minimum level. Therefore, Simulated Annealing is applied in SA-NBC technique. The
objective function value F with a simulated internal energy E, temperature T as control parameter, then frequent iteration as slowly decays of values thus provides
the estimated optimal solution.

For allowing suﬃcient development, the initial temperature (T) is higher adequate. The temperature reduction
function using SA is deﬁned and it is formulated as follows,

T ← γ × T.

(1)

In Equation (1), T denotes temperature it is based on the
current temperature multiplied with the constant factor
(γ). Initial solution is randomly chosen and it is taken as
an optimal solution in SA. Next, the energy of the initial
solution is calculated. A neighboring node of the initial
state is chosen to calculate the energy when temperature
T does not satisﬁes the termination condition.

The current state is replaced with a recently chosen
state when the energy of newly selected neighboring node
is less than or equal to the current state.If the energy
of the new state is higher than the current state, a random value R is selected within the range of (0, 1). When
random value R is less than the transition probability of
the state, the optimal solution is achieved with the aid
of simulated annealing method. After the temperature is
decreased by using Equation (1), this process is continued
until the termination condition T satisﬁed.

Consider the initial state of the node is’x’ and the new
state of the node is ’y’, then the energy of the node is E(x)
and E(y), the state transition probability is formulated as

Pxy = exp(− E(y) − E(x)

KT

).

(2)

From Equation (2), K represents the Boltzmann constant and T denotes the temperature of the material. The
objective function value F is applied to describe the SA
based feature selection algorithm for providing optimal
solution. SA is a cooling scheme for ﬁnding optimal solutions to avoid local optima while searching the solution
space. Based on the state transition using simulated annealing in SA-NBC technique, the optimal energy of the
node is selected for classifying the network intrusion.

Algorithm 1 explains the process of ﬁnding an optimal
state of the node with the aid of simulated annealing.
The state transition carried out through the optimal state
transition in the network. The energy of the new state
is lesser than the current state and the current state is
modiﬁed into new one.
If the R value is less than the
state transition probability, then the random number is
generated. Hence, optimal feature of the node is chosen
from the entire features. Then the intrusion detection and
classiﬁcation is processed with an optimal feature using
NB classiﬁer to detect the normal and anomalous node
behavior in wireless ad-hoc network.

Figure 1: Architecture diagram of simulated annealing
based NB classiﬁer

As shown in Figure 1 the process of Simulated Annealing based NB classiﬁer is used to detect the intrusion in
the network. There are two phases in SA-NBC technique.
The primary phase performs optimal feature selection and
secondary executes attack detection and classiﬁcation to
improve the anomaly intrusion detection in wireless adhoc network.
Initially, the feature of node is extracted
through the simulated annealing. After that, the attack
is identiﬁed and classiﬁed using NB classiﬁer by considering selected optimal features. The brief explanation about
the SA-NBC technique is presented in next subsections.

2.3.1 Simulated Annealing Method

In SA-NBC technique, the primary phase is used to perform the optimal feature selection with the aid of simulated annealing method. Generally, simulated annealing is a method used to solve the optimization issues.The
global optimum feature from the number of features in the
node is identiﬁed with the aid of SA method. After that,
an eﬃcient attack detection and classiﬁcation is processed
to increase the intrusion detection accuracy. In addition,
SA is a probabilistic technique to detect the optimal results and avoiding the local optima when searching the
solution space. In such a case, simulated annealing is an
eﬃcient technique in order to improve the network performance. The solid is eﬃciently heated to provide high
temperature, then left to cool down slowly in simulated
annealing process. During this process, a solid particle
is travel into disordered state through heating the solid
with higher temperature. This in turns, the internal energy gets improved. When gradually cool down, particles
return to the order and it attains the equilibrium state

2.3.2 Naive Bayes Classiﬁer For Anomaly Intrusion Detection

After selecting the optimal feature about the node, then
the attacks detection and classiﬁcation process is carried
out using Naive Bayes Classiﬁer. A Bayesian classiﬁer is
works on the design of a role of (natural) class that predict
the values of features for nodes in the class. The nodes
are grouped in classes since they include common values
for the features. Such classes are further called natural
kinds. If an organizer knows the class, the other features
value of a node is predicted. If it unable to know the class,
Bayes rule can be applied to predict the given class feature
values of a node. The learning agent constructs a probabilistic model for classifying the node features whether
it is normal or anomalous using Bayesian classiﬁer.
It
also uses to predict the classiﬁcation of a new pattern.In
a probabilistic model, the classiﬁcation is a latent variable in which the variable is probabilistically related to
the detected variables.

Naive Bayes is a conditional probability model. The
Naive Bayes classiﬁer performs on optimal feature selection for the node. This means that the probability of one
node feature does not aﬀect the probability of the other.
The independence of the Naive Bayesian classiﬁer is realized in a certain trust network where the features are the
nodes.
The nodes in the network is classiﬁed and represented
by a vector X = (x1, x2,··· , xn). It denotes some optimal features of a node and assigns to this instance probabilities p(Ck|x1 , x2,··· , xn) for each k possible classes Ck.
For each example, the prediction can be computed by conditioning on detected values for the input features and by
querying the classiﬁcation.

From Equation (3), p(Ck|X ) denotes the posterior
probability of class given predictor (feature), p(Ck) represents prior probability of class features and p(X|Ck) is
the likelihood which is the probability of predictor given
class. Then the p(X) is a prior probability of features.

If the denominator is a normalizing constant then the
probabilities provides the value greater than 1 means the
node is normal. If else, the probabilities provides the value
lesser than 1 means node is anomalous. Therefore, the
intrusion detection accuracy is improved by using Naive
Bayes classiﬁer while monitoring the nodes behavior in
wireless ad-hoc network.

The algorithmic process of NB classiﬁer for anomaly

intrusion detection is explained as follows,

Algorithm 2 shows the process of Naive Bayes classiﬁer for detecting anomalous intrusion in wireless ad-hoc
network. The vector representation is used to divide the
nodes in diﬀerent class. After that the conditional probability is applied to take optimal features of a node and
classify the node is normal or anomalous. This in turns
eﬃciently improves the anomaly intrusion detection accuracy. Therefore, Simulated Annealing based Naive Bayes
Classiﬁer (SA-NBC) technique is used to detect the intrusions and monitoring the network activities in an eﬃcient
manner.

3 Simulation Settings

In order to detect anomaly intrusion detection in wireless
ad-hoc network, Simulated Annealing based NB Classiﬁer
(SA-NBC) technique is proposed and simulated using NS2
network simulator. The KDD cup 1999 dataset is taken
from UCI repository for performing the simulation. KDD
cup 1999 dataset contains standard set of data is audited,
which comprises a number of intrusions in a network environment. The features are duration, src bytes, dst bytes,

number of urgent packets, srv count, diﬀ srv count and so
on. Based on these features, the connection is separated
in strong or feasible.
In wireless ad-hoc network, the number of nodes 500
is randomly arranged in an area 1500m × 1500m. Then

speciﬁc level as 20 m/s. The mobile nodes are distributed
using Random Way point model in an area for simulation.
Data packets used in the ranges from 10 to 100. The simulation time is taken as 1500sec. In each scenario, totally

Simulated Annealing based Naive Bayes Classiﬁer
(SA-NBC) technique is evaluated with the existing
A3ACKs [17] and EAACK [15]. The experimental evaluation is carried out with the diﬀerent parameters such
anomaly intrusion detection accuracy, execution time and
throughput. Performance is evaluated along with the following metrics with the help of tables and graph values.

4.1

Impact Of Anomaly Intrusion Detection Accuracy

The anomaly intrusion detection accuracy is measured as
the ratio of the number of node accurately detected as
anomalous to the total number of nodes in network. The
anomaly intrusion detection accuracy is mathematical formulated as follows

AIDA =

From Equation (4), anomaly intrusion detection accuracy (AIDA) is measured in terms of percentage (%). If
the anomaly intrusion detection accuracy is higher, then
the method is said to be more eﬃcient

Table 2 shows the tabulation for anomaly intrusion detection accuracy using proposed SA-NBC compared with
existing A3ACKs [17] and EAACK [15] methods in wireless ad-hoc network. Number of nodes is taken from the
range of 50 to 500 for experimental purpose. From table,
it is clear that anomaly intrusion detection accuracy is
increased for the respective increase in number of nodes
using all the methods.

Figure 2: Measure of anomaly intrusion detection accuracy

Figure 2 shows the performance of anomaly intrusion
detection accuracy using three methods such as proposed
SA-NBC and existing A3ACKs [17] and EAACK [15]
methods. From the ﬁgure, it is clearly illustrated that the
anomaly intrusion detection accuracy is improved in SANBC technique. This eﬃcient improvement in SA-NBC
technique is attained with the help of simulated annealing
based classiﬁcation in wireless ad-hoc network. Then the
Naive Bayes classiﬁer is used to classify the normal and
anomalous nodes in the network based on the optimal feature selection. The condition probability values are considered to detect the anomalous nodes accurately. ThereInternational Journal of Network Security, Vol.20, No.4, PP.730-737, July 2018 (DOI: 10.6633/IJNS.201807 20(4).15)

fore, the anomaly intrusion nodes are detected in wireless
ad-hoc network and thus improve accuracy of anomaly
intrusion detection using SA-NBC technique by 6% and
14% compared to existing A3ACKs [17] and EAACK [15]
methods respectively.

4.2

Impact of Execution Time

Execution time is measured by product of time taken for
detecting an intrusion or attacks in a network with respect
to number of nodes participate in that network.
It is
formulated as given below.

ET = n × Time (intrusion detection).

(5)

From Equation (5), Execution Time ’ET’ is measured
in terms of milliseconds (ms). Lower execution time ensures the eﬀectiveness of method.

Figure 3: Measure of execution time

Table 3 and Figure 3 show the measure of execution
time with respect to varying number of nodes in proposed
SA-NBC technique compared with existing A3ACKs [17]
and EAACK [15] methods. As shown in Figure 4, the
proposed SA-NBC technique provides better reduction in
execution time for intrusion detection when compared to
other existing methods. This eﬃcient reduction of execution time is achieved by the application of Naive Bayes
classiﬁer for MANETs. Data packets are transmitted

through network from source node to destination node
and entire information successfully transferred using proposed SA-NBC technique due to the detection of abnormal node in the network. Hence delay time for transmitting data packets to destination node is reduced eﬀectively. Therefore, execution time for intrusion detection
using proposed SA-NBC technique is reduced by 8% when
compared to A3ACKs [17] and 19% when compared to
EAACK [15] method respectively.

4.3 Impact of Throughput

Throughput is measured by the ratio of successfully received data packets at destination node and total number
of data packets sent through source node. Throughput
rate in wireless ad-hoc network is calculated as shown below.

T =

successfully received data packets
total number of data packets sent

× 100.

(6)

From Equation (6), throughput ’T’

is measured in
terms of percentage (%). If throughput rate is high, then
the network is said to be more secure and eﬃcient.

Table 4 shows the measure of throughput using
proposed SA-NBC technique compared with existing
A3ACKs [17] and EAACK [15] methods. The number
of data packets is taken as the ranges from 10 to 100 for
the experimental purpose. From the table, the throughput of the network is increased with the respective increase in data packets. Proposed SA-NBC technique provides higher throughput when compared to state-of-theart methods.

Figure 4 depicts the result analysis of the throughput
with number of data packets are considered for evaluation process. From the ﬁgure, it is clearly evident that
the proposed SA-NBC technique accurately classiﬁes the
node as normal or anomalous. This technique improves
the performance results when compared to existing methods due to NB classiﬁer in SA-NBC technique. The NB

designed to prevent the network from the intrusion. But,
the intrusion detection was does not eﬃciently carried
out. This problem is solved by SA-NBC technique by using Naive Bayes classiﬁer. Neural network method was
introduced in [14] to distinguish the normal and attacked
behavior of the system based on MLP. But, the normal
and anomalous of the system was not distinguished.

TermID, a distributed rulebased network intrusion detection system was developed in [6] for performing intrusion detection applications in wireless networks. But, the
classiﬁcation was not enhanced using distribution of the
tasks in wireless networks.The SA-NBC technique used to
improve the intrusion detection eﬀectively by means of selecting optimal features of a node in the network. In [7],
IDS based on self-learning technique was developed to
detect the attacks in the network where the system uses
unknown data pattern classiﬁer (Neuro-fuzzy approach)
thus reduces the dimensionality of the dataset. However,
the classiﬁcation was not eﬃcient.

A novel IDS technique of cluster leader election process and a hybrid IDS was introduced in [18].
It provides the intrusion detection service by means of Vickrey
Clarke-Groves mechanism in MANET. However, the intrusion detection rate was not enhanced and reduces the
false positive rate. The cross-layer based distributed machine learning anomaly detection system was developed
in [?] to protect the system. However, the throughput
was not improved. This problem is addressed and it reduced in SA-NBC technique using Simulated annealing
based Naive Bayes classiﬁer.

6 Conclusion

A novel technique is called Simulated Annealing based
Naive Bayes classiﬁer (SA-NBC) is proposed to detect
Anomaly Intrusion Detection in wireless ad-hoc network.
An anomaly-based intrusion detection system is an essential one to observe the network activities and classify whether it either normal or anomalous node. Hence,
the accuracy of intrusion detection is enhanced. In proposed SA-NBC technique, simulated annealing is used to
choose the optimal feature of the node and thus detect
the intrusion in the network. Based on these optimal features, the Naive Bayesclassiﬁer is used to classify the malicious node and normal node with the aid of calculating
conditional probability.
It outlines the vector representation for detecting the network intrusions and observes
network behavior and classifying the node as either normal or abnormal (anomalous). The experiments are conducted on diﬀerent parameters such as anomaly intrusion detection accuracy, execution time and throughput.
The performance results show that the proposed SA-NBC
technique improves the anomaly intrusion detection accuracy, throughput and reduces the execution time than the
state-of-art methods.

Figure 4: Measure of throughput

model classiﬁes the nodes as normal or anomalous in vector consideration in which the nodes are selected with optimal features. With the aid of selected optimal features
of a node, the traﬃc pattern is analyzed in the network.
In addition, simulated annealing is used to perform the
optimal feature selection process for further classify the
node is normal or anomalous in the wireless ad-hoc network. Hence, eﬃcient communication is achieved while
transmitting the data packets through the normal node
and thus improves the performance of the network. This
in turns eﬃcient throughput is achieved in wireless adhoc network. Therefore, proposed SA-NBC technique
improves the throughput by 9% and 19% compared to
existing [17] and EAACK [15] respectively.

The security attacks and intrusion detection systems
method was introduced in [11] for self-conﬁgurable networks. However, the applications are used in the method
was aﬀected by intruders. A novel intrusion detection
system based on the trust rates was introduced in [5]
to detect the intrusive action in MANET. But, the execution time for intrusion detection was remained unaddressed.This issue is overcome by the SA-NBC technique
for improving the performance through identifying the
anomalous node behavior.

Distributed combined authentication and intrusion detection was designed in [2] to maximize security in
MANET. But, trust values from all nodes were not
combined eﬀectively. A behavior-rule speciﬁcation-based
technique was introduced in [9] for intrusion detection in
medical devices. However, the large numbers of nodes
are does not handled eﬀectively. The SA-NBC technique
improves the optimal feature for classifying large number
the anomalous and normal activities in wireless ad-hoc
network.

An intelligent multi-level classiﬁcation technique was
introduced in [3] to detect the intrusion detection in
MANET. The mixture of tree classiﬁer with labeled training data and enhanced multiclass classiﬁer algorithm was
