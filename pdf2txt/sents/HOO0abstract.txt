To be effective instructors and CS education researchers , we must identify and understand student difficulties surrounding core computing topics . 
This study examines student difficulties with the basic data structures commonly found in CS2 courses . 
Initial exploration of student thinking began with think-aloud interviews with students . 
These interviews centered on open-ended questions that were iteratively improved upon based on analysis of interview transcripts . 
The revised open-ended questions were then posed to 249 students during an end-of-term final exam study session . 
Using the explanations and justifications included by students , responses to the questions were coded and summarized . 
This work characterizes the difficulties revealed by student responses , and provides details of their prevalence among the examined student population .
