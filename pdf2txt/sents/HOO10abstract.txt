A wireless ad-hoc network includes huge number of mobile nodes that structure temporary networks . 
Due to the dynamic nature of wireless ad-hoc network , security and eﬃcient intrusion detection system ( IDS ) is a challenging task to detect the intruder nodes . 
The classiﬁcation algorithm is used to detect the intrusions in an eﬃcient manner . 
However , the network is characterized by high mobility they also introduce many vulnerabilities that increase their accurate detection risks . 
The optimization technique is performed to attain eﬀective model for intrusion detection . 
But , the IDS continuously use additional resources to monitoring intruder activity in the network . 
In order to overcome the above issues in wireless ad-hoc network , Simulated Annealing based Naive Bayes Classiﬁer ( SA-NBC ) technique is proposed for Anomaly Intrusion Detection . 
An anomaly-based intrusion detection system is used to detect the network intrusions and monitoring network activities in an exact manner . 
At ﬁrst , the optimal features are chosen for classifying and detecting the intrusion by means of Simulated Annealing ( SA ) method when performing packet transmission . 
Based on these selected features , the accuracy and eﬃciency of trafﬁc pattern analysis is improved using intrusion detection . 
Next , the Naive Bayes classiﬁer is employed to classify the attack depends on features to identify the malicious behavior accurately from normal node in a testing environment by using the Bayes theorem . 
This in turns , the network traﬃc is minimized and increases the accuracy of anomaly intrusion detection . 
The SA-NBC technique conducts the simulations work on parameters such as anomaly intrusion detection accuracy , execution time , and throughput . 
The simulation results demonstrate that the SA-NBC technique is able to improve the accuracy of intrusion detection and also improves the throughput
