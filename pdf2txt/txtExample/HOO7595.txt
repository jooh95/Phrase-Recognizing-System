Artificial Neural Network plays a vital role in Pattern Matching . 
This analysis is beneficial for pruning the neural network architecture additionally as factors governing the training time and overall performance of Multiple hidden layer back propagation neural network . 
Now a days , artificial intelligence have terribly very important role in day to day life . 
whether it 's Finger print recognition or Face detection , artificial intelligence found its usability . 
what is more accuracy is becoming a chief criteria of competition among numerous corporations that develop applications and product based on artificial intelligence . 
Multiple hidden layers ar used wherever it 's troublesome to make a decision the amount of neurons in each hidden layer . 
Here we have a tendency to created associate degree approach in pruning a multiple hidden layer fulfilling all “ Rule of Thumb ” [ 2 ] until utilized in making associate degree optimized design in neural network . 
additionally time complexness analysis of multiple hidden layers with single/dual hidden layer design is bestowed in this paper .
